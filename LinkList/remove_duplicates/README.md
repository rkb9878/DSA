# LL: Remove Duplicates ( ** Interview Question)
You are given a singly linked list that contains integer values, where some of these values may be duplicated.

Note: this linked list class does NOT have a tail which will make this method easier to implement.

Your task is to implement a method called remove_duplicates() within the LinkedList class that removes all duplicate values from the list.

Your method should not create a new list, but rather modify the existing list in-place, preserving the relative order of the nodes.

You can implement the remove_duplicates() method in two different ways:
1. Using a Set - This approach will have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. You are allowed to use the provided Set data structure in your implementation.
2. Without using a Set - This approach will have a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. You are not allowed to use any additional data structures for this implementation.


Here is the method signature you need to implement:
```python
def remove_duplicates(self):
    pass
```

### Example:

**Input**:

LinkedList: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5

**Output**:

LinkedList: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
