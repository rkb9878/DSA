# LL: Reverse Between ( ** Interview Question)
You are given a singly linked list and two integers start_index and end_index.

Your task is to write a method reverse_between within the LinkedList class that reverses the nodes of the linked list from start_index to  end_index (inclusive using 0-based indexing) in one pass and in-place.

Note: the Linked List does not have a tail which will make the implementation easier.

Assumption: You can assume that start_index and end_index are not out of bounds.



**Input**

The method reverse_between takes two integer inputs start_index and end_index.

The method will only be passed valid indexes (you do not need to test whether the indexes are out of bounds)



**Output**

The method should modify the linked list in-place by reversing the nodes from start_index to  end_index.

If the linked list is empty or has only one node, the method should return None.



**Example**

Suppose the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, and start_index = 2 and end_index = 4. Then, the method should modify the linked list to 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 .



### **Constraints**

The algorithm should run in one pass and in-place, with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
